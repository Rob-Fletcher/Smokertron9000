This will be a BBQ/Smoker controller that will monitor and adjust the temperature
automatically.
---
###Hardware
For the controller unit I will use an Arduino. This will monitor the temp and
control small fans and/or servos to open and close the vents. I would like to
several temperature sensors in several places in the smoker.

####Details to work out:
- Connection
   + Most likely wifi. Need to investigate more on wifi for Arduino. Can test
   ethernet cable easily enough.


###Software
I plan on using [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com) to display the information
streaming from the Arduino. This can display all temp information, and info about
the state of vents/fans. This will allow tuning of the software for the ultimate
in BBQ'ed meats.
